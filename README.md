## Powerful Analytics for the Frappe Framework

NOTE: THIS APP IS NOT PRODUCTION-READY, AND IS STILL IN TESTING

This app works to do two things: enables field history tracking, and provides
advanced reports based on the data it creates.

It's important to note that the reporting based on field history will not
be helpful for events pre-installation. The data doesn't exist yet. So, despite
not having many reports right now, you'll want to start building up your data
for later use!!

Field history tracking is enabled on a module-by-module basis in the
"Document Versioning Settings" doctype. Upon changing a document in an enabled
module, the changed field(s) are sorted into a custom doctype named
[doctype] Field History. Again, if in doubt, enable a module. Great use-cases
are CRM, Selling, Projects, Manufacturing, Buying, and Accounts. I would not
enable it for modules like Core, Email, etc.

Reporting is coming soon....here are some potential reports!
  - See your sales funnel and how quickly leads progress by 'status' field
  - With an 'estimated close date' field, see how many opportunities close
    or push in a given time period
  - Create burndown charts for project tasks
  - Track conversion rates through lead and opportunity stages - i.e.
    10% of Prospects become MQL's, 23% of MQL's become SQL's, etc.

If you have a report you'd like to have, or a better method for the backend,
send a pull request!

Reports should be created as a "page" in the analytics app - and should be kept
plug-and-play with the data provided by Frappe and ERPNext.

If your reports will require a custom field that isn't provided, set it up with
fixtures.

#### TO-DO:
Delete a doc's field history when the doc is deleted.
Currently it won't work with the "on_trash" hook, as that runs after the doc
is deleted.

Squash messages for "does not exist" when saving a new field history doctype. 
- checks if the doctype exists to check if the doctype needs to be created

Squash messages for "does not exist" when saving a new record. 
- checks if the record exists (maybe use __local?)
